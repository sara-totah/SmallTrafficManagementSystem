# Traffic Management System (Learning Project)

The Traffic Management System is a C++ command-line application designed as a learning project to practice C++ programming and gain experience in managing vehicle registration, recording challans (traffic violation fines), and simulating traffic control booths. This project aims to help you learn more about C++ development and gain hands-on experience in building a console-based application.

# Features
